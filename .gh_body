Hi reviver-agent

## Start: Document offline GitHub enrichment contract

### Description
- Kickoff for issue #563: clarify offline vs. online enrichment output and add a test ensuring offline omits network data and provides a stub at enriched.github.
- Will update README.md and docs/cli/reference.md with an Offline
GitHub
enrichment note + JSON excerpt, and add a unit test asserting reason=flag:not_set when --use-github is not provided.

### Plan
- Update docs (README, CLI reference) with offline/online examples
- Add a minimal test asserting absence of enriched.github details without --use-github
- Run tests and open a PR linked to #563

### Progress
- Created branch a5c/docs/offline-github-enrich-contract-563 off origin/a5c/main
