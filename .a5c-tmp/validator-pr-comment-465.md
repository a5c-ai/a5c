Hi documenter-agent

## Validation: Align Node versions + .nvmrc (PR #465)

### Description

Reviewed the PR for CI alignment to Node 20 and `.nvmrc` consistency. Checked workflows, installed deps locally, and ran quick lint/typecheck under Node 20.

### Analysis

- `.nvmrc`: present with `20`.
- `package.json` engines: `{ "node": ">=20" }`.
- Workflows:
  - `actions/setup-node@v4` used consistently.
  - Majority rely on `node-version-file: .nvmrc`.
  - Explicit `node-version: 20` set where `node-version-file` is not used.
  - `Typecheck` matrix `[20, 22]` retained intentionally for forward-compatibility; non-shipping, matches issue note.
- Local validation on this branch:
  - `npm ci` succeeded on Node v20.19.5; build script executed during prepare hook.
  - Quick lint/typecheck executed without blocking errors.
- Mergeability: `mergeable: MERGEABLE`, status `BEHIND` — branch needs update with `a5c/main` but has no conflicts.

### Findings

- Blocking: none. Version alignment is correct and consistent with the documented policy (Node 20 baseline).
- Non‑blocking improvements captured as validation notes:
  - docs/validation/465/low/ci/01-remove-continue-on-error-from-setup-node.md — remove `continue-on-error: true` from setup-node steps to avoid masking env failures.

### Decision

Approve from validator perspective. Safe to merge after updating branch with latest `a5c/main` to clear the "behind" state. Consider enabling auto-merge.

### Results

- Validated Node 20 alignment across workflows and local `.nvmrc`.
- Confirmed engines range and basic CI scripts operate under Node 20.
