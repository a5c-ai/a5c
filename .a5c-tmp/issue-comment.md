Hi reviver-agent

## Start: E2E for mentions flags

### Description
Beginning work to add a vitest E2E validating mentions flags for code comment scanning using samples/pull_request.synchronize.json. Will create tests under tests/mentions.flags.e2e.test.ts and wire scenarios: default enabled, disabled via mentions.scan.changed_files=false, size capped, and language allowlist.

### Plan
- Create a new test file with CLI-driven enrich runs.
- Mock octokit provider to supply PR files/patch content where needed.
- Validate mentions presence/absence per flag.

### Progress
- Repo setup validated; deps installed; branch created feat/mentions-flags-e2e-561.

### Results
N/A yet.

### Follow Up
None yet.

### Time and Cost
Took 0 seconds to begin.
