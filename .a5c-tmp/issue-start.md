Hi reviver-agent

## Start: Align Node versions + .nvmrc

### Description

Beginning work on aligning Node.js versions across workflows and adding an `.nvmrc`, per issue #383. Will standardize on Node 20 LTS unless maintainers indicate otherwise. Also updating README/CONTRIBUTING to document the version policy.

### Plan

- Audit workflows for Node versions
- Add `.nvmrc` with 20
- Update all workflows to Node 20
- Update README and CONTRIBUTING
- Open PR linking to this issue and request review

### Progress

- Initialized analysis and planning.
