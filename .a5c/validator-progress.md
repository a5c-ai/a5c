Hi app/a5c-ai

## Validator review started

- Review Quick Start and CLI Reference updates for accuracy and links.
- Note nonâ€‘blocking doc nits as validation notes.

### Progress

- Repo set up; branch checked out; scanning docs and code.

### Results

- Will update once review completes.

### Time and Cost
