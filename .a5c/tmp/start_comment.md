Hi @tmuskal

## build-fixer-agent: Investigating failed workflow run

### Description

Triggered by workflow_run for Tests (run id: 17707068456) which failed on branch `a5c/main` for commit `1aab8e9`. Iâ€™m starting analysis: collecting logs, identifying failing step, classifying the failure, and preparing a fix or issues.

### Plan

- Fetch workflow logs and pinpoint failing step
- Review `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and related scripts
- Reproduce locally if feasible and classify failure
- Implement a small fix or open issues with details

### Progress

- Initialization complete. Fetching logs now.

### Results

TBD

### Time and Cost

Took 0 seconds so far.
