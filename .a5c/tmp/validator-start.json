    "description": "# Your repo becomes your AI team\r\n\r\n**a5c.ai** is a GitHub App that installs **Git-native AI agents** into your existing GitHub workflow. Agents read your repo with full context, open issues and PRs, and deliver production-grade changes — all inside the tools you already use. You review and merge; agents never push direct commits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What you get\r\n\r\n- **Git-native automation** — Agents act on Git events (issues, commits, PRs) and work inside CI/CD to propose changes as pull requests.\r\n- **PR-first by design** — Every action is visible as a PR with diffs, tests, and discussion. You stay in complete control.\r\n- **Prompts & agent files in Git** — Instructions live as Markdown/YAML alongside code, so behavior is versioned, reviewable, and easy to roll back.\r\n- **Composable agents** — Start from proven bases and inherit/extend like Docker layers to fit your stack and style.\r\n- **Full-context reasoning** — Because agents live with your repo, they understand architecture, history, tests, and conventions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How it works (at a glance)\r\n\r\n1. **Store instructions in Git**  \r\n   Define or edit agent prompts/roles as Markdown/YAML committed to the repo.\r\n\r\n2. **Scout & dispatch**  \r\n   Producer agents surface gaps and open issues. Mention the developer agent on any issue to start work.\r\n\r\n3. **Code → Review → PR**  \r\n   Developer agents implement changes and open PRs; reviewer/validator agents comment and suggest fixes.\r\n\r\n4. **Continuously smarter repo**  \r\n   Each merged PR compounds context. Agents learn your codebase, style, and decisions over time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why instructions belong in Git\r\n\r\n- **Audit & history** — See who changed what and why, with blame and PR discussion.\r\n- **Rollback** — Revert behavior like you revert code; fix “prompt drift” instantly.\r\n- **Collaboration** — PMs, security, and engineers co-edit the exact text agents will follow.\r\n- **GitOps for behavior** — Commits are both record and trigger for agent actions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Common uses\r\n\r\n- Keep CI healthy: propose fixes when builds fail and expand tests with changes.  \r\n- Safer refactors: agents respect project structure and coding conventions.  \r\n- Code quality & docs: review diffs, suggest improvements, update docs as code evolves.  \r\n- Security: surface findings in PRs and propose patches.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Security & control\r\n\r\n- Agents operate **only** through issues and PRs; branch protection and reviews apply.\r\n- Instructions are **transparent** artifacts in Git (Markdown/YAML), not hidden chats.\r\n- Works with your existing GitHub org/repo structures and CI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\n1. **Install the a5c.ai GitHub App** on the repositories where you want agents to work.  \r\n2. **Add agent files** (or start from a starter template) to define behavior in Markdown/YAML.  \r\n3. **Open an issue or push a change** — agents analyze context, act, and open PRs for your review.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Build faster with your repo as the source of truth — and your AI team living inside it.**",
