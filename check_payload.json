    "title": "Validation run finished",
    "summary": "Tests pass (86/86). CLI --validate integrated. Blocking issue: enrich --validate with raw payload fails schema (missing repo, actor) due to minimal NE shell in src/commands/enrich.ts. CLI uses cmdEnrich while handleEnrich provides full NE shape. Recommend unifying to handleEnrich or mapping repo/actor in cmdEnrich.",
    "text": "Steps: install, build, run tests, CLI sanity runs. Findings: normalize --validate passes; enrich --validate --use-github exits 3 as expected without token; enrich --validate (no token and no --use-github) still fails schema due to minimal NE shell missing required fields. Lint has warnings only."
