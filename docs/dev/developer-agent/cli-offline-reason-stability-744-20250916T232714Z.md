# CLI docs: align offline reason wording

## Context

Follow-up to PR #744 to unify CLI reference wording with Quick Start: use `flag:not_set` as canonical/stable offline reason; remove "implementation-defined" phrasing.

## Plan

- Update `docs/cli/reference.md` wording to state stability
- Run tests, push branch, and open PR targeting `a5c/main`
