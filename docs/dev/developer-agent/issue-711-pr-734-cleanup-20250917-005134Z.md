# Dev Log – PR #734 Cleanup (Issue #711)

## Context

- PR: #734 (docs: clarify scope for enhancement #711) – draft
- Ask from validator: remove `.tmp_check.json` temp artifact; add ignore rule; optionally add a README one-liner for local validation.

## Plan

- Remove tracked `.tmp_check.json` from branch.
- Add `.tmp_check.json` to `.gitignore` (scoped minimal rule).
- Update README with a "Validate locally" one‑liner using `npm run -s validate:examples` and keep details in `docs/ci/ci-checks.md`.

## Notes

- `package.json` already includes `validate:examples`.
- `.gitignore` already covers several tmp patterns but not `.tmp_check.json` specifically.
