# PR #655 — Docs Lint verification and setup

## Context

- Ensure docs state `composed[].payload` is `object | array | null` per `docs/specs/ne.schema.json`.
- Verify `docs-lint` job exists and runs on PRs and on `a5c/main` pushes.
- Confirm `quick-checks.yml` includes a fast banned phrase scan.

## Actions

- Reviewed `.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml` and `quick-checks.yml` — scope limited to `README.md` and `docs/**`; triggers align with guidelines.
- Confirmed script `scripts/docs-lint.sh` scans markdown (excluding dev/validation logs) and fails on any occurrence of `composed[].payload: any` or `payload?: any` when misleading.
- Ran `scripts/docs-lint.sh` locally: passed (no violations).

## Notes

- `a5c.yml` includes `Docs Lint` in `workflow_run` watched list.
- No content changes required; repo already states the correct types in docs.
