# Docs Link Checker (lychee) â€” Issue #875

## Context

Add lychee-based link checks for README and docs/\*_/_.md with minimal false positives and <2m run time.

## Initial Plan

1. Add `scripts/docs-link-check.sh` with pinned lychee version and cached binary.
2. Add `lychee.toml` to ignore private/scheme links and accept 403/429.
3. Create `docs-links` workflow for PRs (docs/README) and push to a5c/main.
4. Update `.github/workflows/a5c.yml` workflow_run matrix to include `Docs Links`.
5. Verify locally where feasible and open PR.

## Notes

- Keep failures only for definite broken links; tolerate rate limits/timeouts.
- Prefer fast execution and caching to keep PRs snappy.

## Changes Implemented

- Added `scripts/docs-link-check.sh` to install/cache lychee and run checks
- Added `lychee.toml` with ignore patterns and accepted statuses
- Added `Docs Links` workflow `.github/workflows/docs-links.yml`
- Registered `Docs Links` in `.github/workflows/a5c.yml` `workflow_run` triggers

## Verification

- Local hooks passed; CI will cache lychee and run fast on PRs and a5c/main pushes
