Started work to dedupe CLI commands and fix normalize exports per #239.

Plan:
- Remove duplicate emit/validate command definitions in src/cli.ts
- Ensure cmdNormalize is exported only once from src/commands/normalize.ts
- Build and run smoke: normalize -> validate

Progress:
- Patched src/cli.ts to remove duplicated command blocks, re-added single emit/validate, cleaned double exits
- Verified normalize export uniqueness in src/commands/normalize.ts
- Build OK; CLI smoke: normalize outputs JSON; validate command runs as expected

Next:
- Await CI; request validator review
