# Investigate offline enrich failure (issue #242)

## Plan

- Reproduce locally (npm ci, build, test)
- Compare SDK vs CLI offline behavior
- Add coverage for CLI offline reason if missing

## Notes

Initial run shows all tests passing. SDK offline path returns enriched.github with partial=true and reason=github_enrich_disabled. CLI path returns enriched.github with same shape via runEnrich(). Adding CLI test to assert reason to prevent regressions.
