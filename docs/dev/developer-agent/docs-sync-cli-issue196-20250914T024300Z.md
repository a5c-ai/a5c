# Docs sync for CLI flags and examples (issue #196)

## Plan

- Audit src/cli.ts for command/flags
- Update docs/cli/reference.md, docs/user/quick-start.md, README.md
- Add security/redaction and rules usage notes
- Cross-link tests and samples

## Context

Triggered by producer scan gap between specs and implementation.
