title: SDK Quickstart – Issue #794 (initial)
description: Plan and notes for adding minimal SDK usage snippet and links.
---

# Context

Issue #794 requests a minimal programmatic SDK snippet and links from README and Observability docs.

# Plan

- Add `docs/user/sdk-quickstart.md` with a 20–30 line example.
- Ensure APIs used are exported by the package entry (re-export provider helpers).
- Link from README Quick Start and `docs/observability.md`.
- Build and run tests; open PR linked to issue.

# Notes

- Prefer import from `@a5c-ai/events` which re-exports provider helpers.
- Keep OTEL/logging optional (documented, not required).
