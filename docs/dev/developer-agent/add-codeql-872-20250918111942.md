# Add CodeQL code scanning for JS/TS (Issue #872)

## Summary

Add GitHub CodeQL code scanning for JavaScript/TypeScript to run on PRs to `a5c/main` and `main`, protected branch pushes, and weekly schedule. Publish results to the Security tab.

## Plan

- Add `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` with `javascript-typescript` language
- Triggers: `pull_request` (to `a5c/main`, `main`), `push` (a5c/main, main), and `schedule` weekly
- Build: `npm ci && npm run build`
- Upload results via `github/codeql-action/analyze`
- Update `.github/workflows/a5c.yml` to include `CodeQL` in `on.workflow_run.workflows`
- Open PR linking to issue #872 with labels `ci`, `security`, `feedback-loop-optimizer`

## Notes

Use default queries for speed; refine later if needed.
