# Add CodeQL code scanning for JS/TS (Issue #872)

## Summary

Add GitHub CodeQL code scanning for JavaScript/TypeScript to run on PRs to `a5c/main` and `main`, protected branch pushes, and weekly schedule. Publish results to the Security tab.

## Plan

- Add `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` with `javascript-typescript` language
- Triggers: `pull_request` (to `a5c/main`, `main`), `push` (a5c/main, main), and `schedule` weekly
- Build: `npm ci && npm run build`
- Upload results via `github/codeql-action/analyze`
- Update `.github/workflows/a5c.yml` to include `CodeQL` in `on.workflow_run.workflows`
- Open PR linking to issue #872 with labels `ci`, `security`, `feedback-loop-optimizer`

## Notes

Use default queries for speed; refine later if needed.

## Implementation

- Added `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` with JavaScript/TypeScript configuration, default queries, and explicit build (`npm ci && npm run build`).
- Updated `.github/workflows/a5c.yml` to include `CodeQL` in `on.workflow_run.workflows` for aggregator integration.
- Opened PR to `a5c/main` with labels (`ci`, `security`, `feedback-loop-optimizer`).

## Results

- CodeQL workflow will run on PRs to `a5c/main`/`main`, on pushes to protected branches, and weekly via schedule.
- Results will appear under Security > Code scanning alerts after runs complete.
