# Issue #165 â€” Heartbeat alerts for scheduled a5c runs

## Plan
- Add Healthchecks.io heartbeat pings to `.github/workflows/a5c.yml` for `schedule` events only (start/success/fail)
- Reference repo secret `HEALTHCHECKS_A5C_URL`; guard steps when unset
- Add ops runbook at `docs/ops/a5c-heartbeat.md`
- Verify locally: `npm ci && npm test`

## Context
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/a5c.yml`
- Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/issues/165
- Acceptance: Alerts on 2 missed runs; steps present; docs added

## Todos
- [ ] Modify workflow with guarded curl pings
- [ ] New ops doc with triage steps
- [ ] CI passes
