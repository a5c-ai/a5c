# PR #738 - CI commit checks on main PRs

## Plan

- Validate workflows (commitlint & commit-hygiene) include `a5c/main` and `main`
- Ensure a5c workflow tracks them under `workflow_run`
- Typecheck, lint, tests; actionlint
- Rebase branch on `a5c/main`

## Results

- Both workflows target branches: `a5c/main`, `main`
- a5c.yml includes `Commit Hygiene`, `Commitlint` in `workflow_run`
- Typecheck/lint/tests executed locally; actionlint run
- Branch rebased or verified against `a5c/main`
