# Task Log — Issue #557: README Rules quick-start

Start: 20250916T052021Z (UTC)

## Plan

- Add a concise rules example (YAML + CLI) under README > CLI Reference
- Link to specs (§6.1) and CLI reference
- Reuse for runnable example

## Notes

- README already contains a general walkthrough and a short invocation, but lacks inline YAML under CLI Reference.
- CLI docs have fuller examples; we will cross-link them to avoid duplication.
