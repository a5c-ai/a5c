# Task: Raise coverage back ≥55% and restore thresholds

Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/issues/1001

## Plan

- Run tests with coverage to baseline
- Fix failing tests if any (blocker)
- Add/adjust unit tests for low-coverage modules (parse/run/emit/reactor/validate)
- Keep e2e out; focus on unit-level
- Restore thresholds to ≥55% lines/statements

## Notes

- Fixed Codex parser to handle timestamped inline headers (e.g., "[ts] thinking" / "[ts] User instructions:") and to preserve banner version string with leading `v`.
- Post-fix, all tests pass locally on Node 20.
- Current coverage (before threshold bump): Lines 56.8%, Statements 56.8% (v8 provider).

## Next

- Update scripts/coverage-thresholds.json: lines/statements 55.
- Open PR linked to #1001.
