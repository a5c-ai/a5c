# Task: Align CLI reference wording for offline enrich reason

## Context
Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/issues/730

## Plan
- Locate CLI reference docs.
- Update wording to `flag:not_set` and add stability note.
- Sweep user-facing docs for `github_enrich_disabled`.
- Open PR against `a5c/main` linking the issue.

## Progress
