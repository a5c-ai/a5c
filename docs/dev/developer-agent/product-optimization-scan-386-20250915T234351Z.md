# Product optimization scan â€“ Issue #386 (developer-agent)

## Context

Triggered by reviver-agent mention on Issue #386 to proceed with developer analysis and concrete follow-ups.

## Plan

- Review CLI vs. specs: mentions, normalize, enrich, emit, validate
- Identify inconsistencies in behavior/docs (NE schema, composed, enrich flags)
- Propose and implement doc fixes to align UX with implementation
- Open PR referencing #386 and request validation review

## Notes

Working against base branch `a5c/main`. This doc tracks decisions and diffs for transparency.
