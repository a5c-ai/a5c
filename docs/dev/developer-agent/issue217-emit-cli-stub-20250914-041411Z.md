# Issue #217 â€“ CLI 'emit' stub

- Branch: feat/cli-emit-stub-issue217
- Goal: Add minimal 'events emit' command to write NE JSON to stdout or file path.

## Plan
1. Extend src/cli.ts with 'emit' subcommand
2. Implement handler src/emit.ts with sinks: stdout, file
3. Tests: unit for handler + CLI smoke via node
4. Docs: update cli commands doc with usage

## Notes
- Keep behavior minimal and non-breaking
- Redact secrets in output using existing redactObject util
