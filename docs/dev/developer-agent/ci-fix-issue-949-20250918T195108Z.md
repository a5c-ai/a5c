# CI fix: golden mismatch for issue_comment type (issue #949)

## Context

- Failing test: `tests/golden.enrich.test.ts` -> `matches issue_comment.created.enrich.json`
- Golden file: `tests/fixtures/goldens/issue_comment.created.enrich.json` expects `"type": "commit"`
- Implementation: `src/enrich.ts` sets `type = "issue_comment"` when both `issue` and `comment` are present.

## Plan

1. Reproduce failure locally
2. Update golden to `"type": "issue_comment"`
3. Re-run test suite, ensure all pass
4. Open PR referencing issue #949

## Notes

This updates test data to match intended behavior; no code logic changes expected.

## Results

- Updated `tests/fixtures/goldens/issue_comment.created.enrich.json` to `type: "issue_comment"`.
- Focused test passed locally.
- Full suite passed locally via pre-push hook: 180 passed, 1 skipped.
- Draft PR opened: #951.
