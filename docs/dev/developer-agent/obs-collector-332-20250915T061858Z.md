# Composite action: observability collector (Issue #332)

## Plan

- Enhance `.github/actions/obs-summary` to include `run.started_at` and `duration_ms`
- Make artifact upload step resilient with `if: always()`
- Update README for env inputs and usage
- Update `tests.yml` to upload `coverage/coverage-summary.json` and pass `RUN_STARTED_AT`, `CONCLUSION`
- Add README link to action docs

## Context

Existing `.github/actions/obs-summary` collects metadata and coverage into `observability.json` and writes a step summary.

## Validation

Run install/build/test locally; open PR as draft, then finalize.
