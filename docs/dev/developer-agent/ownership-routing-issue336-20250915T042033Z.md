# Dev Log â€” Ownership & routing (Issue #336)

Started: 20250915T042033Z

## Context
Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/issues/336
Goal: Introduce CODEOWNERS and document ownership/routing for this repo.

## Plan
- Create feature branch from `a5c/main`
- Add CODEOWNERS scaffold under `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Add docs at `docs/ownership/README.md`
- Open PR as draft, iterate, then mark ready
- Request review by @validator-agent

## Notes
- Keep CODEOWNERS conservative initially to avoid disrupting branch protection.
- Document how enrichment resolves owners and how labels support routing.

## Progress
- Branch created: `feat/ownership-routing-336`
- Next: add CODEOWNERS + docs and open PR (draft)
