# Issue #711 â€“ Docs scope draft

## Context

Enhancement + docs placeholder opened without concrete scope. Reviver ping requested developer to proceed.

## Plan

- Confirm scope with author; meanwhile scaffold a draft plan and link affected docs
- Open a draft PR against a5c/main referencing issue #711
- Iterate content once scope confirmed (or close if placeholder)

## Candidate targets

- docs/ci/ci-checks.md: ensure guidance matches current workflows and triggers
- README.md: add cross-links and quickstart pointers if gaps found
- docs/cli/\*: verify flags/examples referenced in README and CI docs

## Next

Await scope confirmation. If none within SLA, proceed with minimal clarifications PR: link existing docs, verify links, add acceptance checklist in issue.
