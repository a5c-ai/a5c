# CI Fix Verification: Flaky detector + aggregate checkout (Issue #460)

- Context: Issue #460 and PR #459 (fix/ci-flaky-aggregate-17736378959)
- Scope: Validate workflow fixes for flaky tests detector quoting and adding checkout in aggregate job.

## Steps

- Installed deps, built, and ran full test suite locally.
- Inspected `.github/workflows/tests.yml` changes.
- Verified `continue-on-error: true` for flaky detector and proper quoting inside `node -e` blocks.
- Verified `actions/checkout@v4` added before using local action `.github/actions/obs-aggregate`.

## Results

- Local tests: PASS (123 tests, 46 files) âœ…
- Workflow logic: Correct and resilient; flaky step non-blocking and PR-gated comments.

## Notes

- Branch was behind base; will rebase onto `a5c/main` before requesting validation.
