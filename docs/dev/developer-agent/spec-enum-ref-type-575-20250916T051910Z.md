# Dev Log â€” Spec: Enumerate ref.type in NE schema (Issue #575)

## Context

- Goal: Ensure `ref.type` allowed values are explicit and aligned across schema, code, and tests.
- Observed: `docs/specs/ne.schema.json` already enumerates `ref.type` as `branch | tag | pr | unknown`.
- Tests and provider mapping expect `ref.type === "pr"` for pull_request events.

## Plan

- Keep schema as-is (already enumerated; includes `pr`).
- Clarify docs to explicitly list allowed `ref.type` values and the intent for PRs.
- Run tests to validate Ajv compilation and provider output conformance.

## Notes

- Changing enum to exclude `pr` would break existing tests and mappings. The repo has multiple references asserting `pr`.
