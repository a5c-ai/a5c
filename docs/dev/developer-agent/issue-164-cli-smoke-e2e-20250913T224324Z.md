# CLI Smoke Test - Issue #164

## Context
Implement a fast smoke test to exercise the built CLI (`dist/cli.js`) with sample payloads under `samples/` and guard core flows (`normalize`, `enrich`).

## Plan
1. Add `scripts/smoke-cli.sh` to:
   - Build via `npm run build`
   - Run `node dist/cli.js normalize --in samples/push.json --out /tmp/ne.json`
   - Run `node dist/cli.js enrich --in /tmp/ne.json --out /tmp/out.json --flag include_patch=false`
   - Verify files exist and JSON parses
2. Add a fast `Smoke` workflow for PRs to `a5c/main` and `main`
3. Wire `Smoke` into `.github/workflows/a5c.yml` via workflow_run
4. Validate locally; open PR and request validation

## Notes
- Node 20 required.
- Keep runtime under 60s. Use cached npm install and a single build.
