# PR #771 â€“ Pre-push hook hardening

- Branch: fix/prepush-hook
- Scope: .husky/pre-push, scripts/prepush-related.js, package.json scripts

## Plan

- Ensure hook respects skip env and runs typecheck + related/full tests
- Use vitest via local bin or npx to avoid PATH issues
- Detect base ref preferring origin/a5c/main fallback origin/main
- Verify typecheck and full CI tests

## Actions

- Verified hook logic and permissions (executable)
- Verified script uses local vitest or npx fallback
- Verified base ref detection and related test selection
- Ran npm install, typecheck, related tests, and test:ci

## Results

- typecheck: pass
- related tests: pass
- full test:ci: 59 files, 159 tests passed

## Notes

- No further code changes needed.
- Pre-push hook ready for varied PATH environments.
