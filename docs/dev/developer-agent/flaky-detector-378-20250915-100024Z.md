# Developer Notes â€“ PR #378: Flaky test detector

## Context

Address requested changes: fix flaky-detector tests and ensure CI step emits JSON-only to stdout.

## Plan

- Reproduce failing tests locally
- Ensure script respects `JUNIT_XML` and prints JSON to stdout
- Keep logging on stderr
- Verify workflows produce `junit.xml` and optional vitest JSON

## Actions

- Checked out `chore/flaky-detector-363-a5c`
- Installed deps; build succeeded
- Ran `npm run test:ci`; all tests passed locally
- Verified `scripts/flaky-detector.cjs` reads `JUNIT_XML` and outputs JSON only

## Results

- Tests: green locally
- Mergeable against base as reported by GitHub
- No code changes required; documenting verification
