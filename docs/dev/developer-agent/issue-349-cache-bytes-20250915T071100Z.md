# ðŸ“¦ Cache metrics: hits/misses and restored bytes (Issue #349)

## Plan

- Parse setup-node logs for cache lines: size and primary key.
- Extend `.github/actions/obs-summary` to add `metrics.cache.summary.bytes_restored_total` and per-entry `bytes`/`key` when detected via envs.
- Include succinct line in step summary with size when available.
- Wire `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to pass setup-node `cache-hit` and parse bytes into `CACHE_NODE_BYTES` (best-effort).
- Keep optional; if not present, omit fields.

## Acceptance

- `observability.json` contains `metrics.cache.summary.bytes_restored_total` when restore occurs and env is passed.
- Step summary shows: `Cache: X/Y hits (node: hit, size ~NN MB)` when bytes present.

## Notes

- actions/setup-node does not expose restored bytes as an output. We infer via log parse in workflow and pass as env.
