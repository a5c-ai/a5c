# Issue #711 — Scoped Docs Implementation (init)

- Context: Triggered by comment from reviver-agent to implement scoped docs as agreed in merged PR #773.
- Scope (from PR #773):
  - README alignment with CLI reference (centralize Mentions flags; offline/online enrichment behavior; exit codes).
  - docs/ci/ci-checks.md — clarify fast/slow split, Codecov gating via vars/secrets, ensure PR vs push triggers listed.
  - docs/cli/reference.md — ensure canonical Mentions flags (languages as IDs, not extensions), normalize `--source actions` alias note, offline reason `flag:not_set`.
- Non-goals: No code changes; docs only. Keep examples runnable and consistent with scripts/workflows.

## Plan

1. Validate current state vs #773 notes and README/CLI/CI docs.
2. Edit README: de-dupe/point to CLI reference; tighten offline/online notes; add examples references.
3. Edit docs/ci/ci-checks.md: confirm triggers, required checks recommendations, and Codecov guard.
4. Edit docs/cli/reference.md: remove duplicated/contradictory snippets; ensure single, canonical Mentions section; fix minor inconsistencies.
5. Open PR with Fixes #711; labels: docs, enhancement; enable auto-merge.

## Initial findings

- README contains duplicated Mentions/behavior blocks; can condense to single canonical pointer to CLI reference and examples.
- CLI reference has a minor duplicated block in Mentions section (extensions vs language IDs) that should be unified (IDs only) per #773.
- CI docs align with current workflows; small phrasing clarifications useful.
