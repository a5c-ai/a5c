# Task: PR title Conventional Commits gate on a5c/main — Commit Hygiene (Issue #852)

## Plan

- Update `.github/workflows/commit-hygiene.yml` to make PR title validation blocking when base is `a5c/main`, warning-only for `main`.
- Improve step messages and summary to indicate enforcement mode by target branch.
- Add a short note to `CONTRIBUTING.md` that PR titles must follow Conventional Commits; enforced on `a5c/main`.
- Verify with actionlint and local scripts.

## Notes

- Uses existing `scripts/commit-verify.ts` for validation.
- Commit messages already enforced as blocking on `a5c/main` in the workflow; we won’t alter that logic.
