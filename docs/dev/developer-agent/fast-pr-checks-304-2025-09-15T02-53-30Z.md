## Task: Fast PR checks + push gates (issue #304)

Plan
- Add Quick Checks workflow for PRs (lint, typecheck, vitest)
- Keep/confirm Lint and Typecheck PR workflows
- Restrict heavyweight Build to push on a5c/main, main
- Ensure a5c router listens to Quick Checks/Typecheck/Commit Hygiene
- Document CI split and required checks in docs/ci/ci-checks.md

Changes
- .github/workflows/quick-checks.yml — new fast PR checks
- .github/workflows/typecheck.yml — confirm matrix and triggers
- .github/workflows/main.yml — push-only gates
- .github/workflows/a5c.yml — include Quick Checks and Typecheck in workflow_run
- docs/ci/ci-checks.md — new documentation

Verification
- Ran scripts/test.sh locally; all tests passed (105/105)
- Coverage artifacts present; step summary logic exercised

Notes
- Node 20 for Quick Checks to match engines >=20; Typecheck matrix covers 20/22.
