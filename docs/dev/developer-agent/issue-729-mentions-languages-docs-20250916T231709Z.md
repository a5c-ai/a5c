# Work log: Issue #729 — Reconcile mentions.languages docs vs behavior

## Context

- Implementation: `src/enrich.ts::normalizeLanguageFilters` accepts canonical IDs and common extensions (with/without `.`), mapping to IDs.
- Scanners: `src/utils/commentScanner.ts` detect languages by extension and compare against allowlist of IDs.
- Docs inconsistencies: README previously discouraged extensions; CLI reference mixed guidance.

## Plan

- Update README Mentions section to clearly state: pass language IDs; extensions (with/without dot) are accepted and normalized (e.g., `.tsx → ts`, `.jsx → js`, `.yml → yaml`).
- Update docs/cli/reference.md Mentions Scanning controls: add mapping bullets and remove “values like .ts will not match”.
- Update specs §4.2 Mentions Schema: reflect normalization acceptance + mapping note.
- Add tests covering `.ts` and `.tsx` inputs via flags to ensure normalization.

## Notes

- Source of truth: `normalizeLanguageFilters` in `src/enrich.ts`.
- Ensure no contradictory wording remains.
