# Resolve conflicts for PR #200 (issue #189)

- Branch: `feat/cli-provider-refactor-189`
- Base: `a5c/main`
- Task: Rebase/merge to resolve conflicts, verify build/tests, address validator follow-ups in `docs/validation/200/`.

## Plan
1. Rebase branch onto `a5c/main` and resolve conflicts
2. Run `npm install`, `npm test`
3. Validate CLI and exports remain backward compatible
4. Push changes and update PR

## Notes
- Will regenerate `package-lock.json` if dependency graph changed during rebase.
