# Issue #571 – Align mentions.source spec with implementation

Start: 20250916T051847Z

Plan:

- Remove from docs/specs/README.md §4.2
- Clarify with location in docs/cli/reference.md
- Leave code paths unchanged; run build/tests
- Open PR against a5c/main, link issue

Notes:

- Verified code only emits ; no in types.
