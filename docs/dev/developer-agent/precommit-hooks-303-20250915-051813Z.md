# Pre-commit hooks and local tooling (Issue #303)

## Context
Reviver requested developer action to implement fast local hooks. Repo already has Husky hooks and docs; missing lint-staged configuration and pre-commit is running full lint+tests.

## Plan
- Configure lint-staged for staged files (ESLint + Prettier)
- Update `.husky/pre-commit` to run `lint-staged` and keep filename guard
- Keep `.husky/pre-push` (typecheck + related tests)
- Update docs with usage, skip env, and speed tips
- Validate locally and open PR

## Notes
- Skip via `A5C_SKIP_PRECOMMIT`, `SKIP_PRECOMMIT`, `A5C_SKIP_PREPUSH`, `SKIP_PREPUSH`
- Base ref for related tests: `origin/a5c/main`
