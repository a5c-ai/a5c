# Pre-commit hooks and local tooling (Issue #303)

## Goal
Introduce Husky pre-commit and pre-push hooks with lint-staged to speed local feedback, plus short docs.

## Plan
- Add devDeps: husky, lint-staged
- Configure lint-staged for staged TS/JS and docs files
- Update .husky/pre-commit to use lint-staged (fast, staged-only)
- Add .husky/pre-push to run `typecheck` and targeted tests
- Provide env-based opt-out for CI / emergency skip
- Add developer docs (usage, skip, troubleshooting)

## Notes
- Pre-commit keeps Windows filename guard for ':'
- Pre-push uses Vitest `related` for changed source files; falls back to full run if needed
