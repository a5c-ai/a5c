# Task 554 — Align core types (pull_request, issue_comment) — Specs §3

## Context

- Issue: #554 — Align `docs/specs/README.md` §3 with `ne.schema.json` and tests.
- Problem: `pr` and `comment` are listed instead of `pull_request` and `issue_comment`.
- Note consistency: Add/ensure mapping note that GitHub webhook "issues" → NE `issue` (singular).

## Plan

- Update §3 core types bullets.
- Add a short mapping note under §3 (consistent with notes section and §4 reference).
- Verify schema enum alignment.
- Open PR linked to #554.

## Changes

- docs/specs/README.md — replace `pr`→`pull_request`, `comment`→`issue_comment`; add note.

## Verification

- Quick ripgrep for occurrences and schema enum.
