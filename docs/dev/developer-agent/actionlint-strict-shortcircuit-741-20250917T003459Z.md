# Work log for issue #741

Planned: implement short-circuit after binary findings in strict mode.

## Results

- Implemented strict short-circuit in scripts/ci-actionlint.sh
- Binary exit codes: 0=ok/advisory, 2=strict findings, 1=unavailable
- Top-level caller exits immediately on 2; avoids Docker
- Pre-push test suite: all green
- PR: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/pull/758
