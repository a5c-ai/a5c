# Align offline GitHub enrichment reason to `flag:not_set`

Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/issues/664

## Plan

- Verify current runtime and tests for offline enrichment reason.
- Update CLI reference to reflect `reason: 'flag:not_set'` consistently.
- Keep token-missing and CLI exit code semantics unchanged.
- Run tests locally; open PR to `a5c/main` and ensure CI is green.

## Notes

- Runtime (`src/enrich.ts`) already emits `{ provider: 'github', partial: true, reason: 'flag:not_set' }` when `--use-github` is not set.
- Tests already cover offline path expecting `flag:not_set` (e.g., `tests/enrich.basic.test.ts`).
- CLI reference contained a conflicting sentence mentioning `github_enrich_disabled`. This PR updates it to `flag:not_set` for consistency with code and README.
