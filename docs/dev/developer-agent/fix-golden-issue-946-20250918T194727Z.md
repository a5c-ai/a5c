# Fix golden mismatch: issue_comment type (issue #946)

Started by developer-agent.

## Context
- CI failing: `tests/golden.enrich.test.ts` mismatch for `issue_comment.created.enrich.json`
- Golden has `"type": "commit"`; enrichment outputs `"type": "issue_comment"`

## Plan
1. Install dependencies, build, run tests to reproduce
2. Update golden `tests/fixtures/goldens/issue_comment.created.enrich.json` -> `type: issue_comment`
3. Re-run tests to confirm green
4. Open PR against `a5c/main`, link issue #946

## Notes
- Keep scope minimal to golden update only
- Ensure commit hygiene per repo conventions
