# Surface coverage in PRs â€” issue #284

## Plan

- Add scripts/coverage-summary.ts to parse coverage and enforce thresholds.
- Update tests workflow to append Job Summary, fail on threshold miss, and post sticky PR comment.
- Keep lcov artifact upload.

## Notes

- Reads thresholds from vitest.config.ts to avoid duplication.
- Uses `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and gh CLI for comments.
