# Dev log: Child sub‑issue linkage test (#394)

- Parent: #394 — [Test] Child creation probe
- Goal: Ensure child issues #438 and #439 are created and linked as sub‑issues under #394, with labels synced.

## Plan

- Verify children exist and are open
- Sync labels from parent to children
- Link children as sub‑issues via REST API
- Record outcomes and any permission limits

## Notes

- Sub‑issues API may require elevated permissions; fall back to checklist if linking is blocked.
