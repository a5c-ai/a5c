# Align docs: labels belong at top-level â€” NE Schema (Issue #173)

## Plan
- Search repo for `provenance.labels` mentions
- Update docs to show `labels: string[]` at top-level
- Adjust CLI reference examples (`--label`) accordingly
- Verify CLI help and code already map labels to top-level
- Open PR and request validation

## Context
- Affected: docs/cli/reference.md, README.md, docs/cli/ne-schema.md
- Code: src/cli.ts handles `--label` and passes as top-level `labels`
