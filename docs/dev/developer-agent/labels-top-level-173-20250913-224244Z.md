# Align docs: labels belong at top-level â€” NE Schema (Issue #173)

## Plan

- Search repo for `provenance.labels` mentions
- Update docs to show `labels: string[]` at top-level
- Adjust CLI reference examples (`--label`) accordingly
- Verify CLI help and code already map labels to top-level
- Open PR and request validation

## Context

- Affected: docs/cli/reference.md, README.md, docs/cli/ne-schema.md
- Code: src/cli.ts handles `--label` and passes as top-level `labels`

## Results (2025-09-14)

- Updated README.md to clarify `--label` attaches to top-level `labels[]` for both `normalize` and `enrich`.
- Verified other docs already reflect top-level labels: docs/cli/reference.md, docs/cli/ne-schema.md, docs/specs/README.md, docs/producer/github-adapter.md.
- Tests: 60 passed locally via `npm test`.
- Commit: 3ba84fb (pushed to `feat/docs-top-level-labels-173`).
