# Issue #711 – Docs scope draft

- Context: Enhancement + docs placeholder; needs scope.
- Initial acceptance criteria proposal:
  - Identify target docs (README, docs/ci/ci-checks.md, docs/cli/reference.md).
  - Clarify triggers (PR vs push), env/vars gating, and copy‑paste snippets.
  - Validate links; examples runnable or marked illustrative.
  - CI quick checks green on PR.

Pending confirmation from issue author to expand.

## Update – 2025-09-17

- README: aligned CI “triggers matrix” summary and Codecov upload snippet with `docs/ci/ci-checks.md` (guards via `env.CODECOV_TOKEN` sourced from `secrets` or `vars`).
- CLI Reference: clarified token precedence for `--use-github` (`A5C_AGENT_GITHUB_TOKEN` preferred over `GITHUB_TOKEN`), kept offline behavior and exit codes consistent.
- Next: review `docs/ci/ci-checks.md` for any drift and add runnable enrich examples if needed.
