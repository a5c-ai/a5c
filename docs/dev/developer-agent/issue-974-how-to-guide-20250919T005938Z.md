# Task: Issue #974 — How‑to Guide

- Branch: issue/a5c/971 (existing PR)
- Scope: Add a concise “How‑to” doc for the Events CLI and link it from README.

## Plan

1. Review existing docs to avoid duplication
2. Add `docs/user/how-to.md` (local + CI)
3. Cross‑link from `README.md`
4. Run build/lint/tests

## Actions

- Checked out PR branch, installed deps (`npm ci`)
- Added status check (in progress)
- Authored initial `docs/user/how-to.md`
- Linked from `README.md`

## Next

- Run docs link check and unit tests
- Finalize PR description and mark ready for review
