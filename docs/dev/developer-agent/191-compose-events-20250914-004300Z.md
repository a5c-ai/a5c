# DEV: Issue #191 – Enrichment – Compose events framework

## Context

Implement composed event emission per specs, evaluate simple rules over enriched NE, and emit derived events with key, reason, and targets. Wire to CLI and docs.

## Plan

- Wire rules evaluation in `handleEnrich` and include `reason`.
- Add rules loader/evaluator (YAML/JSON) – reuse `src/rules.ts`.
- Add tests for composed events.
- Add sample rules and docs updates (README, docs/cli/reference.md).

## Notes

Primary branch is `a5c/main`. Working on feature branch and draft PR linked to issue #191.
