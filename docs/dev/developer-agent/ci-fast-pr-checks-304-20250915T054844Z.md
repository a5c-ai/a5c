# CI: fast PR checks and push gates (issue #304)

## Intent
- Fast PR checks: lint, typecheck, unit tests (vitest) with minimal setup and timeouts (<5 min total typical).
- Push gates on a5c/main and main: full build and release only on push.
- Artifacts on failures to aid diagnostics.

## Planned changes
- Adjust existing workflows:
  - PR: run `lint`, `typecheck`, `vitest` only; avoid heavy environment vars and build steps.
  - Push (a5c/main, main): keep build + tests + release as currently defined.
- Add docs under docs/ci/required-checks.md describing triggers and required checks.

## Notes
- Project scripts: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:ci`.
- Vitest config already outputs coverage; keep artifact upload lightweight on PR failures.
