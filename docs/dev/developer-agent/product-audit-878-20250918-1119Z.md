# Dev Log — Product Audit follow-up (Issue #878)

## Context
- Trigger: issue #878 (Scheduled product audit — CLI flows/specs alignment)
- Scope: Docs/CLI flows alignment, Mentions UX, enrichment options

## Plan
- Document `events generate-context` in README and CLI reference
- Clarify `events enrich` input default (GITHUB_EVENT_PATH)
- Add end-to-end GitHub Actions recipe (normalize → enrich → reactor → emit)
- Resolve stale validation notes re: `include_patch` default
- Clarify observability logging toggles per Option B (docs-only)

## Changes
- README: add `generate-context` to command list; link to CLI Reference and E2E example
- docs/cli/reference.md: add full section for `events generate-context`; add GITHUB_EVENT_PATH note under `events enrich`
- docs/ci/actions-e2e-example.md: new consolidated Actions example
- docs/validation/114/*: mark `include_patch` mismatch as resolved and point to sources
- README: replace vague "Debug flags TBD" with a pointer to docs/observability.md and note that CLI flags are not yet implemented (Option B)

## Verification
- `npm ci` and `npm test` — all tests passed locally
- Rendered docs locally; anchors and references checked

## Links
- Fixes: #879, #881, #882, #883
- Addresses: #880 (Option B — docs clarification; flags not implemented yet)
