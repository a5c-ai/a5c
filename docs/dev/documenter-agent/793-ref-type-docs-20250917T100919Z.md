# Task: Clarify ref.type docs â€” NE Schema & README (issue #793)

## Context

Users may be confused about `ref.type` semantics. Specs and schema allow `branch|tag|unknown`, and pull_request events use branch semantics with `ref.base`/`ref.head`. We will update the README Quick Start and add a concise `Ref` subsection in the NE Schema overview.

## Plan

- Update README Quick Start normalization area with a short note on `ref.type` and PR semantics.
- Add `## Ref` section to `docs/cli/ne-schema.md` with enum and PR example.
- Cross-link to `docs/specs/ne.schema.json` and specs doc.

## Changes

- Pending in this branch.

## Results

- TBA after edits and PR.
