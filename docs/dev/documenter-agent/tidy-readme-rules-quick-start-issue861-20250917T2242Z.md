# Doc Work Log — Tidy README “Rules quick-start” (Issue #861)

## Context

- Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/issues/861
- Problem: README has duplicated “Rules quick-start” sections; links should point to canonical docs.

## Plan

1. Keep one concise “Rules quick-start” in README
2. Remove duplicates elsewhere in README
3. Add note: CLI Reference is source of truth for flags/options
4. Link to `docs/cli/reference.md#events-reactor` and specs §6.1

## Actions

- Will edit `README.md` accordingly and keep examples elsewhere untouched.

## Acceptance

- Single “Rules quick-start” in README
- Links present and accurate
- No content loss beyond duplication
