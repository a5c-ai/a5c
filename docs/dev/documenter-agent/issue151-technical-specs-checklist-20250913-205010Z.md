# Documenter: Technical Specs Phase Checklist – Work Log

## Context
Issue: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/issues/151
Goal: Add `docs/producer/phases/technical-specs/checklist.md`, populate status, cross-link to `docs/specs/tech-specs.md`, and add a producer scan summary.

## Plan
- Create phase checklist with ~8–12 items.
- Derive status from code, tests, and CI.
- Cross-link relevant docs.
- Add scan summary under `docs/dev/producer-agent/*-scan-*.md`.
- Open PR against `a5c/main`.

## Notes
Will not update `current-phase.txt` until all checklist items are complete.
