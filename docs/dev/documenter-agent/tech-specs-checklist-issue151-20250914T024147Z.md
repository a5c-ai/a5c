# Work Log — Technical Specs Phase Checklist (Issue #151)

## Plan

- Add `docs/producer/phases/technical-specs/checklist.md` with 8–12 items
- Populate status from current repo (checked/unchecked)
- Cross-link to `docs/specs/tech-specs.md`
- Leave current phase unchanged; note follow-up to flip when complete

## Notes

- Existing specs under `docs/producer/phases/technical-specs/*` cover CLI, providers, integrations, data models, APIs, deployment.
- NE schema present at `docs/specs/ne.schema.json` with Ajv and formats in tests.
- Primary branch: `a5c/main`; PR will target it.
