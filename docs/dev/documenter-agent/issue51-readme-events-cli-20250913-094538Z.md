# Issue #51 – README rewrite for Events SDK/CLI

## Plan

- Analyze current README and specs
- Draft new repo README focused on Events SDK/CLI
- Preserve platform template info in docs and link
- Add install, CLI usage, examples, configuration, samples, dev guide

## Notes

- Current README is template for a5c platform; not package-focused
- Specs located at docs/specs/README.md – align terminology and commands (`events normalize`, `events enrich`)
