# Technical Specs â€“ Architecture and APIs (Issue #18)

Status: started

## Plan
- Scaffold `docs/producer/phases/technical-specs/` hierarchy
- Author initial outlines with concrete TODO bullets
- Cross-link to `docs/specs/README.md`
- Open draft PR against `a5c/main` with labels

## Notes
- Align with product specs in `docs/specs/README.md`
- Keep Node/TypeScript SDK + CLI focus; plugin-friendly design
