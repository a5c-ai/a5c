# Research Log â€“ Specs for docs/specs/README.md (Issue #17)

## Intent
Author comprehensive project specifications for the Events SDK/CLI.

## Plan
- Analyze repo context (workflows, seed constraints)
- Draft sections per acceptance criteria
- Provide examples for GitHub Actions and webhook payloads
- Define MVP vs stretch; roadmap

## Notes
- Primary branch: a5c/main
- Workflows: .github/workflows/{a5c.yml, main.yml, deploy.yml}
- Seed constraints in seed.md (do not write blindly; deliberate research)
