# Build Fix: npx runtime failure due to missing ajv dep

## Context

- Workflow: Packages Npx Test (.github/workflows/packages-npx-test.yml)
- Failure: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'ajv'` when running `npx @a5c-ai/events@latest --help`
- Run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17752973111

## Root Cause (analysis)

- CLI (`dist/cli.js`) imports `ajv` at runtime.
- `ajv` is listed under devDependencies instead of dependencies in package.json, so consumers installing the published tarball via npx do not receive `ajv`.

## Plan

1. Move `ajv` from devDependencies to dependencies (runtime dep for CLI)
2. Build locally and smoke run `node dist/cli.js --help`
3. Open PR targeting a5c/main with details and link to failing run
4. After merge, release will publish; subsequent npx run should resolve `ajv`

## Progress

- Created branch and this progress log.
