# Build Fix: Gitleaks workflow failure

## Context

- Workflow: .github/workflows/gitleaks.yml
- Failure: gitleaks-action@v2 requires license for orgs and no longer supports `args`. Step ran and failed with:
  - "Unexpected input(s) 'args'"
  - "[org] is an organization. License key is required."

## Plan

- Gate gitleaks-action on presence of `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`
- Remove unsupported `with.args` usage for v2
- Provide env vars: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`, `GITLEAKS_CONFIG`
- Keep TruffleHog fallback when license is missing
- Validate with actionlint

## Verification

- actionlint passes locally
- Will rely on CI run for actual behavior
