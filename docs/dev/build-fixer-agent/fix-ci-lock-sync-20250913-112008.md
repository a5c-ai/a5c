# CI Fix: npm ci lockfile mismatch

- Category: Framework/Infrastructure (Category 2)
- Symptom: `npm ci` fails: lockfile out of sync with package.json
- Root cause: package.json updated (@octokit/rest ^21, minimatch ^9) but package-lock.json not updated.

## Plan
- Reproduce locally and run `npm install` to refresh lockfile
- Commit updated `package-lock.json`
- Verify `npm ci` passes locally and `npm test` runs
- Open PR to `a5c/main` with links to failed run

## Notes
- Keep `npm ci` in CI for deterministic installs; fix lock instead of downgrading to `npm install`.
