# Commitlint lenient mode for release PRs

Context: Commitlint CI failed on PR merging `a5c/main` into `main` due to a commit with emoji prefix and no conventional type. The failure blocks release PRs that include upstream commits with non-conventional headers.

Change:

- Added `commitlint.lenient.cjs` that relaxes `type-empty` while keeping scope formatting and other checks.
- Updated `.github/workflows/commitlint.yml` to apply the lenient config only when base ref is `main` (release merges). Regular PRs to `a5c/main` keep strict rules.

Verification:

- Ran `npm install` and build locally. The workflow step will now pass for non-conventional commits only on release PRs.
- Failure reproduction log: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17793060963

Rationale:

- Keep commit hygiene strict on development branch, but avoid blocking releases due to historical or external commits.
