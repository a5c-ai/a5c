# GPR 401 on semantic-release

- Run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17731674206
- Error: npm E401 unauthenticated to npm.pkg.github.com during @semantic-release/npm publish on a5c/main prerelease.

## Plan

- Force GPR publish to use GITHUB_TOKEN, not NPM_TOKEN (npmjs).
- Update release.yml env for semantic-release steps.
- Verify build locally.
- Open draft PR.
