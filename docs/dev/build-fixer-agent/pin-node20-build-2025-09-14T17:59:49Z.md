# CI Build Failure Analysis â€“ Pin Node 20 for Build

## Context
- Failing run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17714660971
- Workflow: .github/workflows/main.yml (Build)
- Symptom: Vitest failures under Node 22; local passes under Node 20.

## Plan
- Align Build job Node to v20 (LTS) to match tests.yml and local
- Leave other workflows unchanged for now

## Notes
- engines in package.json: ">=20"
- tests.yml already uses Node 20; release/lint use 22
