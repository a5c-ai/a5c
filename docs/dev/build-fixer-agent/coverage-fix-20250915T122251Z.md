# CI Fix: Coverage threshold failure on Tests workflow

- Context: workflow_run failure for Tests on branch a5c/main.
- Run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17732561925
- Head commit: 8ec793dc1a7759a31fd4325b889ad0bca713ea3d

## Plan

- Reproduce locally and inspect coverage summary.
- Identify under-covered files causing sub-60% lines/statements.
- Exclude CLI entrypoint `src/cli.ts` from coverage (instrumentation mismatch when invoking built CLI).
- Verify thresholds pass locally, open PR to a5c/main.

## Notes

Vitest shows `src/cli.ts` at 0% since CLI tests spawn `node dist/cli.js` (compiled JS, not instrumented TS). Excluding the entrypoint from coverage aligns with intent and removes noise.
