# Build Fix: Robust flaky tests detection step

## Context

- Failed run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17730718365 (Tests)
- Failure step: "Flaky tests detection" with Node inline eval SyntaxError.
- Category: Framework/Infrastructure (non-critical analysis step causing job failure).

## Plan

- Replace inline Node eval with script file to avoid YAML quoting issues.
- Guard execution to only run on pull_request events.
- Add continue-on-error for non-critical observability step.
- Output JSON summary and (if PR) upsert a comment; do not fail.

## Verification

- npm ci
- Static check of workflow syntax
- Ensure script handles missing artifacts gracefully.
