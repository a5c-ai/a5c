# build-fixer-agent plan: fix npm ci failure due to invalid ajv dependency

Context: GitHub Actions Build run 17751795464 failed on step `./scripts/build.sh` with `npm ci` error. Root cause is `package.json` has `"ajv": null` under dependencies, breaking lockfile and `npm ci`.

Plan:
- Fix package.json: ensure `ajv` and `ajv-formats` are valid runtime deps.
- Run clean install and build locally.
- Push branch and open PR linking the failed run.

Verification steps:
- `npm ci` succeeds.
- `npm run build` succeeds.
- `npm run test -w` optional.
