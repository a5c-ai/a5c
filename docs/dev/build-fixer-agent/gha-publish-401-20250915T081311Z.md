# Build Fix: 401 on GitHub Packages publish

Context: Release workflow failed on publishing to GitHub Packages with E401 Unauthorized from @semantic-release/npm on run 17726327509.

Plan:

- Adjust Release steps to use GITHUB_TOKEN for GPR
- Keep npmjs publish using NPM_TOKEN
- Verify local build passes
- Open PR and link failing run

Notes:

- Root cause: `NPM_TOKEN` secret points to npmjs token; used for GPR publish causing 401.
