# CI fix: add retries around semantic-release for transient GitHub 5xx

- Category: Infrastructure (CI workflow reliability)
- Context: Release workflow failed with 502 from @semantic-release/github during success step
- Link: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17771835443

## Plan

- Wrap `npx semantic-release` with retry-on-transient-5xx network errors
- Keep behavior unchanged for genuine failures
- Apply to both a5c/main and main release steps

## Changes

- .github/workflows/release.yml: add retry loop and exponential backoff around semantic-release

## Verification

- Local install/build succeeds
- Expect subsequent Release runs to auto-recover from intermittent GitHub 5xx
