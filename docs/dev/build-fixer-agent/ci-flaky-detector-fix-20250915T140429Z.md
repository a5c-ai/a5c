# CI: Tests workflow failure analysis and resolution

- Workflow run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17734995400
- Category: Framework/Infrastructure
- Root cause: Inline flaky-detector script errors and non-guarded duplicate step causing job failure despite tests passing.
- Resolution: Already fixed in latest `tests.yml` by removing the flaky-detector inline steps and keeping only stable observability.
- Verification: Local npm ci/build/test succeeded. Current workflow has no failing steps locally.
