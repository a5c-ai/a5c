# Fix failing Tests workflow: generateContext `this` handling

## Context

- Workflow: Tests (.github/workflows/tests.yml)
- Failed run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17828694500
- Branch: a5c/main
- Failure: unit tests — test/generateContext.test.ts (expected `List: x y` but rendered `[object ...]`)

## Root Cause

Template engine did not bind `this` within `{{#each}}` blocks. Expressions were evaluated via `new Function(...)` without a `this` binding; `{{ this }}` resolved to global `this` instead of the current item.

## Change

Bind `this` for expression evaluation by wrapping compiled expression in a function and calling it with `thisArg = ctx.vars.this`.

File: src/generateContext.ts

## Verification

- Ran `npm install` and targeted test: `npm test -t generate_context` → passed.
- Affected tests: only generateContext test failed in CI log; local targeted pass confirms fix.

## Follow-ups

- None; flaky-detector step failure is non-blocking (continue-on-error) and unrelated.
