# Build Fix: generateContext each {{ this }} binding

- Trigger: workflow_run failure https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17793060942
- Cause: template engine rendered `[object Object]` for `{{ this }}` inside `#each` blocks, failing test `test/generateContext.test.ts` which expected `List: x y`.
- Fix: bind `this` to the current item when evaluating expressions so `{{ this }}` resolves to the iterated value. Implemented `evalWithThis` and used it for variable interpolation.
- Files changed: `src/generateContext.ts`
- Local verification: `npm test` passes (62 files, 162 tests).
- CI impact: should turn the failing Quick Checks job green.

## Plan

1. Fetch and inspect run logs
2. Reproduce locally
3. Patch template evaluation to support `this`
4. Run tests locally
5. Open PR to `a5c/main`

## Results

All tests pass locally; ready for PR.
