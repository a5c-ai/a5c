# Fix TS1128 in src/enrich.ts on a5c/main

- Start: 20250914-070221Z
- Failed run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17707776088
- Symptom: TS1128 at src/enrich.ts:285 during tsc build

## Plan
1. Inspect src/enrich.ts on a5c/main for brace/structure issues
2. Align braces and blocks with working main version (no logic changes)
3. Build locally to verify
4. Open PR with context and verification steps
