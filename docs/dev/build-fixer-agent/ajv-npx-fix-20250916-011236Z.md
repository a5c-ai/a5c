# Build Fix: npx runtime Ajv import missing

- Context: Packages Npx Test failing with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'ajv'` when running `npx @a5c-ai/events@latest --help`.
- Root cause: CLI imported `ajv` at top-level; package published with Ajv as devDependency only, so npx runtime couldn't resolve it when executing non-validate commands.

## Plan

- Lazy-load Ajv inside `validate` command to avoid requiring it for other commands.
- Move `ajv` and `ajv-formats` to runtime dependencies in package.json.
- Verify build and tests locally.

## Work

- Updated `src/cli.ts` to dynamic import Ajv only in `validate` action.
- Moved Ajv modules to `dependencies` in `package.json`.
- Installed, built, and ran tests: all green (132 passed).

## Next

- Open PR against `a5c/main` and link failing run.
- After merge, rerun Packages Npx Test to confirm fix.
