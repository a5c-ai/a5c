# CI Fix: Flaky detector quoting + aggregate checkout

- Context: Failed run https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/actions/runs/17736378959
- Branch: a5c/main
- Failures:
  - Unit Tests: step "Flaky tests detection" failed due to shell quoting inside `node -e` (single quotes inside single-quoted shell string).
  - Aggregate Observability: local action `.github/actions/obs-aggregate` used without a prior checkout in the `aggregate` job.

## Plan

- Gate PR feedback step to PRs and make it non-blocking (continue-on-error).
- Fix quoting in Node inline script to avoid single quotes; use double quotes consistently.
- Add `actions/checkout@v4` at start of `aggregate` job.
- Validate locally: install, build, test.

## Verification

- Run scripts locally; ensure no failures.
- Push branch and open PR against a5c/main; link failing run.
