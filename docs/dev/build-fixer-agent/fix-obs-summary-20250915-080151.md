# Fix: Observability composite action quoting error

- Context: Workflow run 17725902461 failed on step "Observability summary" due to `ReferenceError: number is not defined` coming from inline Node script in `.github/actions/obs-summary/action.yml`.
- Root Cause: Shell single-quoted heredoc for `node -e '...'` caused the JS snippet to be transformed with `typeof e.bytes === number` (missing quotes) at runtime in some environments, throwing a ReferenceError.
- Fix: Switch to a safe heredoc (`node - <<'NODE' ... NODE`) and keep the correct JS literal `typeof e.bytes === 'number'`, eliminating shell quoting pitfalls.
- Verification: Ran `./scripts/install.sh && ./scripts/test.sh` locally. All tests passed, and build completes. This would avoid the failing step in CI.
