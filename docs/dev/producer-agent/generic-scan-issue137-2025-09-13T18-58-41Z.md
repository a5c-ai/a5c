# Producer – Generic Scan Log (Issue #137)

## Context
Triggered by comment to run a generic scan. Analyze `docs/specs/README.md` vs. current implementation and phase files to propose actionable issues.

## Plan
- Verify phase and specs files
- Compare CLI features vs. specs (normalize, enrich, mentions)
- Check enrichment flags (include_patch, limits)
- Review tests and coverage targets
- Examine workflows and token precedence
- Scan docs/validation tech-debt

## Findings
TBD – populated through this run.

## Proposed Issues
TBD – grouped by area, with acceptance criteria.
