# Producer Scan â€“ Issue #147

## Context
Triggered by issue #147 mention to assess specifications vs implementation, capture gaps, and create actionable tasks.

## Findings Snapshot
- Specs: docs/specs/README.md present; NE schema docs/specs/ne.schema.json
- Phase: Specification Phase (docs/producer/phases/current-phase.txt)
- Implementation: CLI commands `mentions`, `normalize`, `enrich`; GitHub enrichment module; tests via Vitest; GH Actions for build/test/lint/release.

## High-level Gaps Identified
1. Technical-specs checklist missing; phase transition not reflected.
2. CLI flags in specs vs implementation: select/filter/pretty not implemented.
3. Mentions extraction for code comments in changed files not implemented.
4. GitHub enrichment gating: `--use-github` flag not wired to skip network calls; token handling implicit.
5. Token precedence and redaction: tests missing; docs exist.
6. Composed events emission logic missing (spec section 9 Examples).
7. Plugin API and provider abstraction not aligned with tech-specs (commands folder structure differs).
8. E2E golden outputs coverage limited; no fixtures for composed events.

## Next Steps
- Create issues per gap with acceptance criteria and priority.
- Update phase tracking: move from Specification -> Technical Specification where appropriate; create checklist.
