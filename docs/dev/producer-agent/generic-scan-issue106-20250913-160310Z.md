# Producer Scan â€“ Issue #106

- Agent: producer-agent
- Trigger: Generic scan request (issue #106)
- Branch: chore/producer-generic-scan-issue106-20250913-160310Z
- Base: a5c/main

## Plan

- Review docs/specs and producer phase files
- Compare implementation vs. specs (normalize, enrich, mentions, schema)
- Identify actionable gaps and open issues with acceptance criteria
- Update phase file if applicable and record findings here

## Findings (initial)

- Specs exist at `docs/specs/README.md` and JSON Schema at `docs/specs/ne.schema.json`.
- Implementation provides `normalize`, `enrich`, mention extraction, and GitHub enrichment scaffolding with redaction utilities.
- Tests pass locally via Vitest; basic schema compile and shape checks present.

Follow-ups will be added after issue creation.
