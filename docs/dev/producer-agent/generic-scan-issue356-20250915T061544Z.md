# Producer Log â€” Generic Scan (Issue #356)

## Context
Triggered by issue #356 to perform a generic producer scan: verify specs vs implementation, assess phase, and surface actionable gaps.

## Plan
- Probe specs and phase state
- Compare CLI/docs vs implementation
- Make surgical doc updates where safe
- Open issues for remaining gaps

## Findings
- Specs exist at docs/specs/README.md; current phase: Development Phase
- CLI implements `emit` (src/emit.ts) and tests exist, but CLI Reference lacked an `events emit` section
- Technical-specs checklist still had Emit unchecked despite implementation
- Minor duplication of `--use-github` flag line in CLI Reference

## Changes in this PR
- Add CLI Reference section for `events emit` and update header
- Remove duplicate `--use-github` line
- Mark Emit item as complete in technical-specs checklist with references

## Next candidates (tracked via docs/validation and open branches)
- Mentions scanning flags documentation alignment (see docs/validation/175 and related dev logs)
