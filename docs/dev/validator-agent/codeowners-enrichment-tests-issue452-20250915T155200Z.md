# Validator Dev Log â€“ CODEOWNERS enrichment tests (Issue #452)

## Goal

Add stable unit tests covering:

- `enriched.github.pr.owners` per-file mapping
- `enriched.github.pr.owners_union` sorted, de-duplicated union
- Behavior when CODEOWNERS missing or only comments

## Plan

1. Mock Octokit in tests to feed CODEOWNERS content and PR files.
2. Add tests under `tests/enrich.codeowners.test.ts` with focused cases:
   - union across multiple files and owners
   - empty union when no matches
   - present-but-commented CODEOWNERS does not crash
3. Run Vitest locally and in CI.

## Notes

Implementation lives in `src/enrichGithubEvent.js`:

- `getCodeOwners()` parses active rules and ignores comments.
- `resolveOwnersForFiles()` returns per-file owners from Minimatch.
- Union computed via Set and sorted before emission.
