# Conflict Resolution Log – PR #679

- Started: 2025-09-16T14:13Z UTC
- Base: a5c/main
- Head: a5c/docs/cli-filter-exit-examples-677
- Run: https://github.com/a5c-ai/events/pull/679

## Summary

Merged latest `a5c/main` into the PR branch and resolved two markdown conflicts by keeping the properly formatted multiline content and removing conflict markers.

## Conflicted Files

- docs/dev/conflict-resolver-agent/resolve-conflicts-pr-656-20250916T101445Z.md
- docs/dev/developer-agent/offline-reason-664-20250916T111945Z.md

## Rationale

Both conflicts were formatting-only (single-line vs multiline markdown). Preserved the clearer, multiline versions to maintain readability and consistency with other dev logs.

## Verification

- Built project and ran full test suite locally — 160 tests passed.
- No runtime/source changes.
