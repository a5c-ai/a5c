title: Link CLI Reference section for `events validate`
severity: low
category: documentation
---

The README now includes `events validate` and examples. Consider adding a short cross-link near the top CLI list to the detailed section in `docs/cli/reference.md#events-validate` for discoverability.

Rationale: Users scanning the README may miss deeper options; a one-line link improves UX without duplicating content.

Suggested change (non-blocking):
- After the command list in README, add: “See CLI Reference for full `validate` options.”
