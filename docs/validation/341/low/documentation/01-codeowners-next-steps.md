# [Validator] Documentation – CODEOWNERS rollout next steps

### Summary

Initial scaffold for `.github/CODEOWNERS` is intentionally commented to avoid abrupt review requirements. Ownership README explains enrichment fields (`enriched.github.*.owners`, `owners_union`). No blocking issues detected.

### Recommendations (Non‑blocking)

- Define real teams and map directories (e.g., `src/**`, `src/providers/**`, `.github/workflows/**`, `docs/**`).
- Prefer team handles (`@org/team`) over individuals; ensure teams exist before use.
- Start with broad directory patterns; avoid many file‑level rules.
- Stage changes in small PRs, monitor review behavior and branch protections.

### Acceptance

- Real CODEOWNERS rules added in follow‑up PR(s) with minimal churn.
- Ownership README updated to reflect actual team mappings.
