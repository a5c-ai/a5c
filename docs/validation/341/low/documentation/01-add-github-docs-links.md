# Add links to GitHub CODEOWNERS docs

Priority: low
Category: documentation

## Summary
In `docs/ownership/README.md`, add a short "Further reading" section linking to GitHubâ€™s official CODEOWNERS documentation for quick reference.

## Rationale
New contributors may benefit from authoritative references when updating CODEOWNERS rules. This improves onboarding and reduces ambiguity.

## Suggested Changes
- Append a "Further reading" section with links:
  - https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
  - https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#codeowners-file-location

## Acceptance Criteria
- README updated with the links in a concise section near the CODEOWNERS guidance.
