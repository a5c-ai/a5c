# [Low] Documentation clarifications for Observability summary action

- Clarify in the PR doc that `.github/actions/obs-summary` is already correct and no code change is included in this PR.
- Include a direct code reference to the numeric guard used today for cache bytes aggregation:
  - File: `.github/actions/obs-summary/action.yml`
  - Snippet: `typeof e.bytes === 'number'` inside the Node script when summing bytes.
- Consider adding a short example of how org-level workflows can consume this composite action to avoid drift.

Rationale: Improves clarity for readers and future audits without changing behavior.
