# [Validator] [Documentation] - Align schema path references

The repo contains `docs/specs/observability.schema.json` as the authoritative path. An older legacy copy previously lived under `docs/schemas` and has been removed. Ensure all docs/tests reference the `docs/specs/...` path consistently.

Scope: Non-blocking.
