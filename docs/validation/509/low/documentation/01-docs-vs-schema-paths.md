# [Validator] [Documentation] - Align schema path references

The repo contains both `docs/specs/observability.schema.json` (authoritative) and an older `docs/schemas/observability.schema.json`. Ensure all docs/tests reference the `docs/specs/...` path consistently and mark `docs/schemas/...` as legacy or remove in a follow-up.

Scope: Non-blocking.
