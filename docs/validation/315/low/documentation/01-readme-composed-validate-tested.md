Title: README composed+validate walkthrough â€” verified

Category: documentation
Priority: low

Summary:
- Executed README steps locally: normalize -> enrich with rules -> jq del(.composed) -> validate.
- Pipeline exits 0 and matches described behavior.

Notes:
- Direct enrich of raw payload requires normalization first to satisfy NE schema's required fields (repo, actor) before validation. README uses normalize first implicitly via prior sections and explicitly here with an out file.

Artifacts:
- Verified on branch docs/composed-validate-example-issue-295 at commit HEAD.
