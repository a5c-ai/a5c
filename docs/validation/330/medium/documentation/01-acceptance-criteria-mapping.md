# [Validator] Documentation – Acceptance Criteria Mapping for Observability Discovery

### Context

PR #330 adds an observability discovery document for CI/agents. To make the plan actionable, include an explicit Acceptance Criteria section aligned to Issue #306 with measurable thresholds and verification methods.

### Proposal (Non‑blocking)

- Add an “Acceptance Criteria” section to the discovery doc covering:
  - Flaky tests: definition (e.g., >1 retry in last 10 runs), alerting threshold, owner, tracking label.
  - Long jobs: p95 job duration per workflow with initial target and warning threshold.
  - Reruns: alert when `run_attempt > 1`, with run URL and root cause tag.
  - Cache hits/misses: per-job rate, target range, and remediation note.
  - Coverage: global threshold and per-package delta tolerance surfaced in PR.
  - Agent step latency: target, warning threshold, and annotation rule.
- For each, include: metric source, surfacing channel, owner, and “how validated in CI”.

### Rationale

Makes the discovery directly implementable and testable by mapping signals → thresholds → ownership → verification.

### Scope & Priority

Non‑blocking; documentation only. Priority: medium.
