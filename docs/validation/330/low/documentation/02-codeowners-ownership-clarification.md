# [Validator] Documentation – CODEOWNERS and Routing Clarification

### Context

The doc proposes ownership (CI/Platform, Agents SIG). Anchor this in CODEOWNERS and labels for smooth routing.

### Proposal (Non‑blocking)

- Add/ensure CODEOWNERS entries for `.github/workflows/**` (CI/Platform) and `/.github/workflows/a5c.yml` (Agents SIG co‑owner).
- Document labels: `ci-failing`, `flaky-test`, `observability` with brief usage.
- Add a short “Routing” subsection in the discovery linking owners and labels.

### Rationale

Codifies routing to reduce triage friction.

### Scope & Priority

Non‑blocking; docs clarity. Priority: low.
