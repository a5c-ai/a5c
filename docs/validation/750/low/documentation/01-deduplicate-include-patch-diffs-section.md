# [Low] Documentation — Duplicate "Include patch diffs explicitly" sections

- File: `docs/cli/reference.md`
- Context: The "Include patch diffs explicitly (opt‑in)" example block appears three times in succession.
- Impact: Minor readability issue; users may think there are distinct variants.

Suggested fix:

- Keep a single example block and remove the two duplicates.

Notes:

- Non-blocking; does not affect correctness of this PR.
