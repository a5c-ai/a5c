# [Validator] [Documentation] - Composite action README enhancements

Priority: low priority
Labels: validator, documentation

## Summary

Improve `.github/actions/obs-summary/README.md` with:

- Note recommending `if: always()` when using the action to ensure summary/artifact on failures.
- Explicit mention that Node.js is required (Ubuntu runners have it by default, but self-hosted may not).
- Example showing overriding `JOB_NAME`, `WORKFLOW_NAME`, and custom `OBS_FILE`.
- Link to where `observability.json` is uploaded in the workflow run (Artifacts section) and sample JSON shape.

## Rationale

Clarifies usage and expectations; reduces confusion in repos without Node preinstalled.

## Suggested changes

- Add a "Requirements" section (Node 18+).
- Add a "Best practices" section with `if: always()`.
- Add a JSON sample block with `run`, `metrics.coverage.total` snippet.
