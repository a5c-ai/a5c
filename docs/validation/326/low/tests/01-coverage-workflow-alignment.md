# [Low] Tests/CI - Coverage workflow alignment notes

Context: PR #326 adds `scripts/coverage-summary.js` and updates `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to surface coverage in the job summary, upload artifacts, and post a sticky PR comment. Local validation confirms thresholds parsing from `vitest.config.ts` and correct exit behavior.

Observations
- Coverage script parses thresholds via a simple regex; resilient enough for current config, but fragile to major formatting changes.
- Tests workflow posts a sticky comment only when `event == pull_request`; OK. Job summary is always appended when available.
- Enforce step relies on previous step output (`status != 0`) to fail the job. This is explicit and readable.
- Artifacts include `coverage/lcov.info` and `coverage/coverage-summary.json`; sufficient for external tools.

Non-blocking suggestions
- Consider adding a “needs-coverage” label toggle to skip PR comment on certain labels (optional).
- Consider echoing the thresholds and a short legend in the job summary for clarity (title already includes emoji state).
- Add a brief comment in `vitest.config.ts` near thresholds noting CI enforcement via `scripts/coverage-summary.js`.
