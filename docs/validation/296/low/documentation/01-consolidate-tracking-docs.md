# [Validator] [Documentation] - Consolidate duplicate tracking docs

Two tracking docs exist for Issue #287 on this branch:
- `docs/dev/developer-agent/issue-287-feedback-loop-tracking-20250914T224014Z.md`
- `docs/dev/developer-agent/feedback-loop-tracking-issue-287-20250915T003530Z.md`

They appear to track the same scope with overlapping content. Consolidate into a single file and adopt a consistent naming convention for future tracking docs to avoid fragmentation.
