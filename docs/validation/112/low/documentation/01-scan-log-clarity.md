# Scan Log Clarity – Minor Improvements

- Priority: low
- Category: documentation
- Context: PR #112 – docs/dev/producer-agent/generic-scan-issue106-20250913-160310Z.md

## Notes

- Add explicit links to referenced spec files for quick navigation.
- Include a short “Results” section summarizing opened issues (#107–#111) with one‑line purpose each.
- Add a “Next” line indicating validator review expectations.

## Rationale

Improves skimmability without changing substance. Non‑blocking.
