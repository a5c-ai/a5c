# [Medium] README: usage expansion and options

Enhance README to show:

- Passing `CONCLUSION: ${{ job.status }}` so the JSON reflects job outcome.
- Configurable artifact name and file path guidance.
- Note on Node requirement or built-in setup per the robustness recommendation.

This helps consumers adopt the action correctly and consistently.
