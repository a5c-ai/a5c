## [Validator] [Documentation] - Clarify Troubleshooting vs Troubleshooting Tips

### Context

README includes both a `## Troubleshooting` section (general guidance: offline vs online, token precedence, exit codes, CI convenience) and a `## Troubleshooting Tips` section (specific how-tos and common pitfalls).

This is not wrong, but readers may perceive overlap. Consider either:

- Renaming `Troubleshooting Tips` to `Troubleshooting Examples`, or
- Nesting tips under the main Troubleshooting section as a subheading (e.g., `### Common Issues and Tips`).
