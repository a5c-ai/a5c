## [Validator] [Documentation] - Add official CODEOWNERS semantics link

### Context

- PR: #656 — “Semantics — owners_union vs GitHub last-rule”
- Files: README.md; docs/cli/reference.md; docs/routing/ownership-and-routing.md

### Observation

- The docs correctly describe union vs. last-rule semantics and provide examples.
- Adding a link to GitHub’s official CODEOWNERS docs would help readers verify the “last matching rule per file” rationale.

### Recommendation

- In `docs/routing/ownership-and-routing.md` Semantics section, include a reference link to GitHub’s docs:
  - https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

### Priority

- Low (non-blocking)
