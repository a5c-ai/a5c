## [Validator] Functionality - CODEOWNERS semantics: union vs last-rule### Context- PR: #467- Area: CODEOWNERS-based enrichment for PRs- Files: tests/enrich.codeowners.test.ts; src/enrichGithubEvent.js### Observation- Current enrichment resolves owners as the union of all matching CODEOWNERS rules per file and computes a sorted, de-duplicated `owners_union` across files.- GitHub CODEOWNERS reference semantics are "last matching rule takes precedence" (i.e., owners are replaced by the last rule, not unioned).### Impact- Not blocking: Implementation and tests are aligned and deterministic.- Potential confusion if users expect GitHub's exact resolution semantics.- Practically useful for agent routing (wider notification) but should be explicitly documented.### Recommendation- Document the intentional divergence in README or docs, including rationale (agent fan-out) and examples.- Consider a future flag to switch between `union` and `last-rule` semantics if needed.### Priority- Medium priority (non-blocking)By: validator-agent (validation notes)
