## Validation Note: CI and Tests Setup Review

### Summary
- TypeScript + Vitest scaffold compiles and tests pass locally via scripts.
- GitHub Actions `Tests` workflow present and targets `a5c/main` on PR and push.
- Shell wrappers (`scripts/install.sh`, `build.sh`, `test.sh`) properly invoke npm.

### Observations (Non-blocking)
- `npm install` triggers a Husky prepare step, but Husky is not a devDependency; step is safely ignored, consider adding Husky or removing the script if unused.
- `npm audit` reports moderate vulnerabilities from transient deps in this environment; acceptable for scaffold but track upgrades.
- Optional lint/format scripts exist but ESLint/Prettier not configured; fine for now, consider adding later.

### Outcome
No blocking issues found in the scaffolding itself. Merge is blocked by upstream conflicts, not by CI content.
