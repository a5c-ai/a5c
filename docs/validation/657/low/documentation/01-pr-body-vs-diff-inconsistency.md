# [Low] Documentation â€“ PR body vs diff inconsistency

PR #657 description states that `docs/routing/ownership-and-routing.md` is updated to correct CODEOWNERS ordering guidance. However, the diff on this branch only adds a developer worklog file and does not touch `docs/routing/ownership-and-routing.md`.
