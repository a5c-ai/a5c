# [Low] CI - Consider explicit job timeout and concurrency

### Context
The `Docs Links` workflow has sensible defaults, but it can be safer to:
- Set an explicit `timeout-minutes` on the job (e.g., `5`).
- Add a small `concurrency` group to auto-cancel superseded PR runs.

### Recommendation
- Add `timeout-minutes: 5` under `jobs.links`.
- Optionally add:
```
concurrency:
  group: docs-links-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
