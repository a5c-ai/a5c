# Dev log timestamp placeholder

The dev log file contained a shell placeholder for the start time:
`$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)`. Replaced with a fixed ISO timestamp to
preserve auditability in Git history.

Recommendation: dev logs should record concrete timestamps and avoid dynamic
placeholders.
