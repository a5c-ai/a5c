# [Low] README: Link to commit guidelines

The README adds a brief note about Conventional Commits. Consider adding an explicit link to `docs/contributing/git-commits.md` near the Contributing section to make the policy more discoverable for new contributors.

Suggested change: add a oneâ€‘line link under Contributing.
