# [Validator] [Refactoring] - Duplicate workflow entry for PR Size Labels

### Context

- File: `.github/workflows/a5c.yml`
- Observation: `PR Size Labels` appears twice in the `on.workflow_run.workflows` list.

### Impact

- No functional issue (GitHub ignores duplicates), but it adds noise and may cause confusion during maintenance.

### Suggested Fix

- Remove the duplicate `PR Size Labels` item to keep the list deduplicated.

### Priority

- low
