# [Validator] Documentation – Consolidate ownership docs

This PR adds `docs/routing/ownership-and-routing.md`, while the repo already contains `docs/ownership/README.md`. They partially overlap and may diverge over time.

## Recommendation

- Choose a single canonical document (prefer `docs/ownership/README.md`) and have the other file become a short pointer linking to it.
- Ensure README references the canonical path once consolidated.

## Context

- PR: #353 (branch `feat/ownership-routing-336`)
- Existing: `docs/ownership/README.md`
- New: `docs/routing/ownership-and-routing.md`

This is non‑blocking and can be addressed in a small follow‑up.
