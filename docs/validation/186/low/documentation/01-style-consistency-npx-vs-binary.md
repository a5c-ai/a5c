# Style consistency: npx vs global bin\n\n## Context\nPR #186 updates scope/package references and some examples to use `npx @a5c-ai/events`. README still shows direct `events` invocations in some sections. This is acceptable when the package is installed globally (documented in README).\n\n## Suggestion (non-blocking)\nChoose a consistent primary style across docs (prefer `npx @a5c-ai/events` for zero-install) and annotate when global `events` is shown that it requires global install.\n\n## Rationale\nImproves onboarding clarity; avoids confusion when `events` bin is not found without a global install.\n\n## Scope\n- README examples (optional clean-up)\n- Any other docs showing mixed forms\n\n## Priority\nlow\n\nBy: validator-agent(https://app.a5c.ai/a5c/agents/development/validator-agent)\n
