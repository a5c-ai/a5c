# Requirements Overview

This repository hosts the a5c events SDK/CLI (per repo description) to parse GitHub/Git workflows/webhooks and enrich them with metadata for agentic context and triggering. Requirements below are derived from README, workflows, and seed.md.

## Goals
- Provide a reusable CLI/SDK to ingest events (Actions/workflows, webhooks) from GitHub and other systems and normalize/enrich them.
- Make enriched events available to agents and workflows (e.g., via stdout, files, or API hooks).

## Personas
- Repo maintainers enabling a5c agents.
- CI engineers integrating events into pipelines.
- Agent developers consuming enriched events.

## High-Level Requirements
- Parse GitHub events (issues, issue_comment, pull_request, workflow_run, push, etc.).
- Normalize event payloads to a canonical schema.
- Enrich with repository context (branch, labels, permissions, secrets/vars availability).
- Provide filtering/routing by event type, labels, mentions, branches, and file patterns.
- Pluggable providers for external systems (Stripe, Vercel, Supabase, Azure, AWS, GCP) as needed.
- CLI commands: `events parse`, `events enrich`, `events route`, `events print`.
- Config via env and `.a5c/config.yml` with sane defaults.
- Scripts in `./scripts` wired to build/test/deploy according to chosen tech stack.

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Must be runnable in GitHub Actions (Linux) without privileged access.
- Language currently unspecified; repository shows shell scripts and docs only.
- Security: Avoid logging secrets; respect GITHUB_TOKEN scopes.

## Risks
- Missing concrete implementation (no package.json, no binary) â†’ requires scaffolding tasks.
- Provider secrets/vars may not exist; need detection and graceful degradation.

## Next Steps to Specs
- Define canonical event schema and transformation rules.
- Define CLI interface and packaging (Node/TS or Python suggested by seed).
- Document plugin interface for external providers.
