# Technical Specs Checklist

This checklist tracks readiness of the technical specifications to proceed into scaffolding and development.

## Structure & Indexing
- [x] Tech Specs index present (`README.md`) with navigation
- [x] Core sections scaffolded (Tech Stack, System Architecture, Components, APIs, Data Models, Events, Integrations, Testing, Deployment)

## Core Content
- [x] Tech Stack drafted (`tech-stack.md`)
- [x] System Architecture drafted (`system-architecture.md`)
- [x] Components outlined (`system-components/*` including CLI, Core, Providers, Enrichers, Storage)
- [x] APIs outlined (`apis/*` including CLI Commands, Node API, Plugin API)
- [x] Data Models drafted (`data-models/*` including Normalized Event and Enrichment Types)
- [x] Events detailed (`events/*` including Input Mapping, Output Contracts)
- [x] Integrations drafted (`integrations/*` including GitHub Actions, Webhooks, MCP)
- [x] Testing strategy drafted (`testing/strategy.md`)
- [x] Deployment notes drafted (`deployment/publishing.md`)

## Quality & Cross-Cutting
- [ ] Constraints and non-functionals captured (performance, security, compatibility)
- [ ] Token/secret handling and redaction covered (link to CLI docs or spec)
- [ ] Backwards compatibility/versioning approach stated (NE schema)
- [ ] Open questions, assumptions, risks documented
- [ ] Traceability to issues and tasks (links from docs to issues/PRs)

## Handoff Readiness
- [ ] Minimal scaffolding plan outlined (packages, directories, entry points)
- [ ] Initial tasks for development created and linked
- [ ] Acceptance tests/E2E stories identified for MVP

Notes
- Pre-checked items are based on current docs present in this repository as of this PR.
