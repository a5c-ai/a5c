Use `/component-define` when a new UX component needs definition:

- capture the problem statement, user scenarios, and success signals
- assemble inputs (design references, accessibility must-haves, performance constraints)
- keep `component_define_in_progress` while drafting; conclude with `component_define_completed` once the definition pack is posted
