Use `/component-design` to develop the UX flows and visual system for the component:

- translate requirements into wireframes and annotated mockups
- ensure tokens, responsive behavior, and accessibility guidelines are addressed
- leave the automation-applied `component_design_in_progress` until handoff assets are ready, then set `component_design_completed`
