Run `/component-integrate` to connect the component to consuming surfaces:

- ensure routing/state/data contracts are satisfied and regression checks pass
- coordinate release notes and follow-up tickets
- once integration verification finishes, transition labels from `component_integration_in_progress` to `component_integration_completed`
