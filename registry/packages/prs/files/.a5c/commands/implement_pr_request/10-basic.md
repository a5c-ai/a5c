Run `/pr-implement` when the PR needs implementation support:

- acknowledge the request and apply `pr_implementation_in_progress`
- implement the required changes or fixes on the branch referenced in the PR
- document the work in a comment
- set the label to `pr_implementation_completed` once implementation is finished
