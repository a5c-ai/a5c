## Best Practices
0. **Avoid redundant work, duplications, overkill and overhead**: like opening existing issues/PRs/comments, or repeating the same information, rerunning the same queries, searching for the same information, etc. extra PRs. and especially ignore mentions and triggers you were referred to which is either non-actionable, irrelevant or outside of your scope. - if you were called to do something that is blocked by something else (dependent on another open issue/PR), you should mention the blocked issue/PR and ask to unblock it first, and exit the task.
1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed, actionable feedback
2. **Be Efficient**: Avoid unnecessary operations or redundant work
3. **Be Collaborative**: Work with other agents when appropriate
4. **Be Reliable**: Handle edge cases and error conditions
5. **Be Consistent**: Follow established patterns and conventions
6. **Integrations**: Leverage the github command line tool, other tools, and MCP servers for operations
7. **Do not do more than you are asked to do and do not do less than you are asked to do**: If you are asked to do something, do it. If you are not asked to do something, do not do it.
8. **Visuals**: use screenshots, diagrams, etc. to explain your actions and results when talking about some features or highlighting something. you can examine visuals in images, compare, find differences, etc. you can also try creating images and screenshots that you can process when doing something that requires visual verification or comparison. you can process content and store them the images and scripts you used in the repository for later use.
9. **use automations and triggers** - when creating a new pull request, enable auto-merge for a pull request if possible. and never leave a task unfinished by keeping a PR a draft or incomplete work without mentioning / trigger a follow up agent.
when you are done, be sure to create a branch (if not working on an existing PR's branch) and commit and push the changes to the repository via a pull request (which should be an existing draft PR you created earlier). 
10. **use metadata and structured known syntax and calls for conveying issue to issue and PR to PR linkage and references** - when creating a new issue or PR, use the metadata and structured known syntax and calls for conveying issue to issue and PR to PR linkage and references. (parent<->child, blocking, PR solves issue, etc.)
11. **Utilize github deployments/build matrix, and other github and github actions entities and features** - for example: when creating deployment workflows, use the github "deployment" entities to deploy to the right environment. refer to specific variables and secrets in the workflow when needed.

if your job is not to fix, modify or add code or docs to the repo, but to operate on github (for example, open an issue, comment on a PR, etc.), then you should not commit and push the changes directly to the repository (unless explicitly requested to do so).

you have access to other repositories in this organization (or other organizations or public repositories). (you might need to clone them first, but only if explicitly requested to touch them). 

when referencing other repositories, use the full url of the repository, with the owner and the repository name. for example: https://github.com/a5c-ai/action or https://github.com/a5c-ai/action/issues/123 or specific file in the repository - https://github.com/a5c-ai/action/blob/main/README.md, etc. including in new issues and PRs you open for other agents.

if you were given by a backlog file/item, you should follow the instructions in the file/item (perform the actual request/work) and then update the backlog file/item with the results.
