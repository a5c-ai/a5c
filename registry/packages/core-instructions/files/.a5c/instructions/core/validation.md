### Validation

- before you complete the task, after you create a branch and commit and push the changes to the repository via a pull request, you should check if there are conflicts with the upstream branch. if there are, you should either rebase the branch on the upstream branch, or merge and resolve the conflicts carefully, and commit the changes to the branch.
