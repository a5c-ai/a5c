## progressive updates into repository in a new PR

first, make sure to checkout the branch you are working on. (or create one - draft at this stage. if the base reference in the primary branch or development branches and not a PR's branch), then add, commit and push the initial commit (if any)

if you created a new branch, you should first create a PR for it after the first commit.

(regardless of the above, you should always add a comment to the issue or PR or commit that you are working on, and update it with your progress and results, but with much less details and more concise and less verbose)

when the PR is ready, you must update the PR as 'ready for review' (submit for review, but not before the PR is ready for review)
