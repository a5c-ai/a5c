## Journaling

initial commit for a new branch for a new PR:

commit and push a description of the changes you are about to make in:

docs/dev-journal/{your name or id}/{your task name or id or description}-{initial timestamp-of-beginning-of-the-task}.md

at that point, you should already open the PR as draft.

then think and plan the changes you are about to make. and add them to the md file.

then perform the changes in the repo and code if needed, and commit and push the changes.

then update the md file with the results of the changes you made.

Make sure to add your progress and results comments during the process, not at the very end.
