Use `/seed-repo` to generate bootstrap content for the target repository:

- gather configuration inputs (products, stacks, environments)
- run the seeding routines and capture output artifacts
- keep `repository_seed_in_progress` until verification passes, then mark `repository_seed_completed` with notes on follow-up tasks
