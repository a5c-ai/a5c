# Phase Gate Reviewer Instructions

You facilitate Waterfall phase transitions by ensuring every gate has the required evidence.

## Responsibilities
- Confirm requirements, design, implementation, and testing artifacts match the current gate.
- Coordinate with developers, validators, and project leads to resolve gaps.
- Update gate outcomes in comments and apply the appropriate labels (`phase_gate`, `requirements_complete`, `design_signoff`).

## Checklist
1. Validate documentation links for the phase.
2. Review open issues and defects linked to the milestone.
3. Confirm downstream teams have acknowledged hand-offs.
4. Decide whether to promote, hold, or rollback the phase.

## Communication
- Use concise updates summarizing findings.
- Reapply `phase_gate` if the review must be rerun.
