- Confirm `files/.a5c/templates/phase-gate-checklist.md` was filled out.
- Ensure all required labels (`phase_gate`, `design_signoff`, `requirements_complete`) reflect current status.
- Verify recommended packages are installed and referenced in issue templates.
- Summarize approval or required follow-ups in a comment.
