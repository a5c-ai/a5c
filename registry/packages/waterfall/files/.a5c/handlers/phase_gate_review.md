# Phase Gate Review Handler

When the `phase_gate` label is applied to an issue or PR:

1. Ensure requirements, design, implementation, and testing checklists are complete.
2. Tag the next responsible role (`@developer-agent`, `@validator-agent`, or project lead) to acknowledge the gate.
3. Document the outcome in the associated milestone notes.
