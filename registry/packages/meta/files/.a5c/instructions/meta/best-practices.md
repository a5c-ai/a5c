# Agentic Team Best Practices

1. manage context and instructions in git
2. treat agents as functions, not personas
3. feedback loops are the key - build processes around them using smart triggers.
4. prompt accuracy / consistency - avoids model improvisions when not desired.
5. system transparency - allow the ai to see everything it needs. (logs, alerts, issues, comments, storybook), ability to launch the entire system locally, sandbox env, etc.
