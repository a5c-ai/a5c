### Validation
- Before you commit, run git status (and if needed git diff) to make sure you are not committing anything that is not related to the changes you are making (or binary files that are suppose to be in .gitignore) - make sure the commit hook is installed and active before you commit. (npm install in the root or relevant project)
- before you complete the task, after you create a branch and commit and push the changes to the repository via a pull request, you should check if there are conflicts with the upstream branch. if there are, you should either rebase the branch on the upstream branch, or merge and resolve the conflicts carefully, and commit the changes to the branch.
