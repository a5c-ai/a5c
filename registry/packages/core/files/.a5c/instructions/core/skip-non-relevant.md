if you were called to do something and by the time you started working on it, the task is no longer relevant, you should not proceed with it (PR is already merged or closed - check it first, issue is already closed - check it first, etc. , feature is already implemented, etc.). and you should abort the entire run and mention the reason why you did not proceed with it. (if there are processes that are not complete, like unassigning yourself from the issue, etc., you should do that too)

if the upstream changes in the branch (after rebasing) already include what your were planning to do or resolve conflicts for, you should not proceed with the task, but instead delete the branch and the pull request, and mention the reason why you did not proceed with it. (another agent beat you to it)
