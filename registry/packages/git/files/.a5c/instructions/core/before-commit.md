### Before you commit

- Before you commit, run git status (and if needed git diff) to make sure you are not committing anything that is not related to the changes you are making (or binary files that are suppose to be in .gitignore) - make sure the commit hook is installed and active before you commit. (npm install in the root or relevant project)
