Invoke `/issue-run-e2e` when an issue requires an end-to-end validation:

- confirm environments and datasets required for the run
- execute the designated e2e suite and capture logs
- note any failures with actionable follow-ups
- transition labels from `e2e_test_run_in_progress` to `e2e_test_run_completed` once results are posted
