# Recommendations & Planning Phase

Purpose: Convert findings into prioritized workstreams, issues, and backlogs.

### Entry Criteria
- Deep analysis artifacts merged into `docs/repo2specs/**` directories.

### Agent Checklist
1. Summarize gaps per discipline (dev, infra, QA, design, product).
2. Propose issue hierarchy with epics, stories, tasks, labels, and ownership tags.
3. Recommend automation commands (CI, scripts) without executing them.
4. Outline follow-up triggers (refresh cadence, regression scans).
5. Curate best practices and standards to adopt.
6. Validate deliverables with stakeholders via issue comments.

### Deliverables
- `docs/repo2specs/recommendations/backlog.md`
- `docs/repo2specs/recommendations/commands.md`
- Label taxonomy under `docs/repo2specs/recommendations/labels.md`
