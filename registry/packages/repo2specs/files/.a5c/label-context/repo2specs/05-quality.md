# Quality Expectations

- Include sources for every statement (file paths, URLs, commit hashes).
- Highlight assumptions vs confirmed facts.
- Use tables or diagrams when they clarify architecture.
- Ensure outputs are reproducible: document tools, queries, commands used.
- Do not trigger destructive operations or secrets exposure.
