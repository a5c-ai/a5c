# Execution Process

1. Intake: gather metadata, define plan, identify stakeholders.
2. Deep Analysis: extract detailed specs and documentation.
3. Recommendations: structure follow-up work and automation commands.
4. Follow-up/Refresh: revisit outputs, update backlog, maintain currency.

All phases must leave written artifacts in `docs/repo2specs/**`.
