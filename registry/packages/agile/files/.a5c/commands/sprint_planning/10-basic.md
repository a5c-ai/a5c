Conduct sprint planning:
- Review sprint goal worksheet (`files/.a5c/templates/sprint-goal.md`).
- Select backlog items with `backlog_ready` label that support the goal.
- Confirm capacity and note supporting packages (tests, infra, docs).
- Apply `sprint_goal` to the sprint goal item and record commitment.
