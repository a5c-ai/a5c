Facilitate the sprint retrospective:
- Review metrics (velocity, defect counts, blocker frequency).
- Use retro notes to propose process improvements or automation via A5C packages.
- Record action items, owners, and timelines.
- Update milestone entity and backlog with continuous improvement tasks.
