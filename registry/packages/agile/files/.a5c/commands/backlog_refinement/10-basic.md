Facilitate backlog refinement:
- Review new and existing backlog items against specs using `files/.a5c/templates/user-story.md`.
- Ensure each item has acceptance criteria, spec references, and supporting packages identified.
- Apply `backlog_ready` to items that meet the definition of ready.
- Capture follow-ups for items needing more discovery.
