Run the daily standup:
- Gather updates from each team member (yesterday, today, blockers).
- Highlight any `sprint_blocker` items and escalate with relevant agents.
- Check milestone entity state and adjust if necessary.
- Capture action items and post a summary comment referencing spec sections or goals.
