# Backlog Management Process

1. Capture new work items from specs, stakeholder feedback, and retrospectives.
2. Classify items into epics, features, and technical tasks.
3. Prioritize collaboratively with product owners and delivery leads.
4. Ensure each backlog item has acceptance criteria, links to specs, and supporting packages identified.
5. Review and refine backlog at least once per sprint.
