Use `/pr-fix-conflicts` or `/pr-resolve-conflicts` when merge conflicts block PR #{{event.pull_request.number}}:

- inspect the conflicting files and understand the changes on both branches
- resolve conflicts directly on the PR branch, preserving intent from each side
- run the necessary checks/tests to confirm stability
- leave a summary comment with verification evidence
- tag stakeholders if manual follow-up is required before completion
