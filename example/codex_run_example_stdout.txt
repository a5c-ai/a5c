## another part

**Exploring user request**

I need to understand what the user means by "Repo: a5c-ai/events" and "another part." It feels a bit vague, so I suspect there's an issue in the repository that they want help with. My next step will be to explore the repository itself. I'll run a command to list the files so I can see what’s going on. That should give me a better idea of how to help!
[2025-09-19T11:58:12] codex

I’m going to scan the repo to understand its structure and look for any failing tests or obvious TODOs to identify what “another part” might refer to.

**Clarifying the task**

I need to figure out what the user means by "another part." It seems cryptic and might refer to another section of a multi-PR challenge, possibly indicating some tests are failing. To address this, I think I should just run the tests. The approval policy never really gets in the way, but I can still run commands. So, I might go with running `npm test` to check the `package.json`.
[2025-09-19T11:58:16] codex

I’ll inspect package scripts and run tests to see what’s failing.

**Running tests with npm**

I'm thinking about running `npm test`, which will also build the project first. This seems like a straightforward plan to make sure everything is functioning as intended. It’s always good to catch any issues early during the test phase, right? I’ll execute the command and see what results pop up. Let’s get those tests running!
[2025-09-19T11:58:20] codex

I’ll run the build and test suite to surface any failing cases we need to address.

**Troubleshooting TypeScript error**

I'm running into a TypeScript compile error saying it cannot find types for 'node'. Even though we have `@types/node` listed in our devDependencies, the compiler seems to be struggling to find the type definitions. I wonder if the tsconfig build is using `"types": ["node"]` but might actually need a `"typeRoots"` configuration instead. I think I should open `tsconfig.build.json` to check this out further.
