# CODEOWNERS — initial scaffold
#
# Purpose: Establish clear code ownership and enable routing/auto-mentions.
# This initial version is intentionally conservative: all rules are commented
# out to avoid accidentally blocking merges if branch protection requires
# CODEOWNERS reviews. Replace placeholders with real teams/users and uncomment
# in follow-up PRs.
#
# Notes:
# - Use GitHub team handles (e.g., @org/team) or individual users (e.g., @user)
# - Patterns are evaluated top-to-bottom; last match wins
# - Keep rules stable; prefer directories over many file-level entries
#
# Examples (commented out):
#
# Root ownership (fallback for everything not matched above)
